***Build the docker image from the source repo
***Publish the docker image to a registry where you can access it
***Deploy the following service to your kubernetes system:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: audit-webhook-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: audit-webhook
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80

***Deploy the following deployment to your kubernetes system (note - you need your own "regcred" secret deployed and need to set your image appropriately):
	***(NOTE:  The "command" shouldn't really be necessary, as it should be set via Dockerfile, but I couldn't get it to work...it works this way)
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: audit-webhook-deployment
  labels:
    app: audit-webhook
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: audit-webhook
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: audit-webhook
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: audit-webhook-application
        image: wfmjdcimagecr.azurecr.io/k8s-audit-webhook:build-1803-v1
        command: ["dotnet.exe", "kubernetes-audit-webhook.dll"]
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: regcred

***Determine the IP address of the service you just deployed
***Create a file on your master node called "audit-webhook-kubeconfig" in the /etc/kubernetes directory, with the following text (update the IP with the IP of your service you created):
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    server: http://10.0.245.224/api/audits
  name: audit-webhook-service
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: audit-webhook-service
    user: ""
  name: default-context
current-context: default-context
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users: []

***Modify the /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml file to add the following parameter:
 "--audit-webhook-config-file=/etc/kubernetes/audit-webhook-kubeconfig",
 
***Delete the kube-apiserver pod so it's forced to restart with the new configuration (or just do sudo systemctl restart kubelet.service)

***View the logs for your pod to see the output!!!


***OTHER STUFF TO EVENTUALLY CONSIDER:
- Get it working with TLS/SSL
- Use the kubernetes service host name instead of hard-coding the IP address in the kubeconfig
- Push to OMS instead of STDOUT on the pod
- Figure out how to use certificate/credentials to call the webhook service
- What else?
